**AWS Lib** is minimalist implementation, truly **object-oriented** and **interface-based** with **immutable** objects, 
for Amazon Web Services.

The code have some principles:
 1. all classes are sealed
 2. all methods return an interface or primitive type
 3. all public methods are implementations of interface methods
 4. all instances are immutable
 5. memory is released automatically 

## A "Bigger" Example using **Amazon S3**

Bellow you see a complete example to create a new Bucket and send a file on it.

``` pascal
program s3;
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}
uses
  aws_client,
  aws_s3;

begin
  TS3Service.New(
    TAWSClient.New(
      TAWSSignatureVersion1.New(
        TAWSCredentials.New('access_key', 'secret_key', True)
      )
    )
  )
  .Buckets
  .Put('mys3examplebucket', '/')
  .Objects
  .Put('foo.txt', 'plain', './foo.txt', '');
end.
```

First a Region object was created -- this is your connection to the Amazon services.

Second, using just one line, the code creates a new Bucket and put a new file on it.

No need to release memory!

To get this file that was sent, use the code:

``` pascal
  TS3Service.New(
    TAWSClient.New(
      TAWSSignatureVersion1.New(
        TAWSCredentials.New('access_key', 'secret_key', True)
      )
    )
  )
  .Buckets
  .Get('mys3examplebucket', '/')
  .Objects
  .Get('foo.txt', '/');
  .Stream
  .SaveToFile('./foo.txt');
```

To delete this file on server, use the code:

``` pascal
  TS3Service.New(
    TAWSClient.New(
      TAWSSignatureVersion1.New(
        TAWSCredentials.New('access_key', 'secret_key', True)
      )
    )
  )
  .Buckets
  .Get('mys3examplebucket', '/')
  .Objects
  .Delete('foo.txt');
```

## Dependencies 

There is only one dependency: [Synapse](http://synapse.ararat.cz/doku.php/download)

Synapse is used as HTTP client.  You can customize or create a new client using another lib like lNet, fpHttpClient, whatever.
